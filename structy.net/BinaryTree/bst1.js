/*
Write the function solution which takes a matrix of integers and creates an array out of it in a zigzag fashion. This means traversing the first row forwards, the second row backwards, and alternating until the last row.

Example:

[[1, 2, 3, 4],
 [5, 6, 7, 8],
 [9, 10, 11, 12],
 [13, 14, 15, 16]]
returns [1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 7, 6, 5, 9, 10, 11, 12, 16, 15, 14, 13].

[execution time limit] 4 seconds (js)

[input] array.array.integer arg1

[output] array.integer
