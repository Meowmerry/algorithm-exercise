**** Logarithms *****
===========================================================================

- We've encountered some of the most common complexities: O(1), O(n), O(n2)

- Sometimes big O expressions involve more complex mathematical expressions

- One that appears more often than you might like is the logarithm!

*********** Wait, Whati's a log again? *************
log2(8) = 3
lgot2(value)  = expontent--------------> 2 exponetsn = value

We'll omit the 2

log ==== log2



Logorithm example
if we can algorithm with O(log n) will be good

Number 8 will be log(8) = 3
8 / 2 ==> 4
4 / 2 ===> 2
2 / 2 ===> 1

Number 25 will be log(25) = 5
25 / 2 ==>
