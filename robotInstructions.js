/* 
Write a function called robotInstructions which accepts an array of moves. The options for the moves are "U", "D", "L", "R". The function should return an object with one key for each move with their values being the total number of times each move appears.
Examples:
robotInstructions(["U", "D", "L", "R"])
{ "U": 1, "D": 1, "L": 1, "R": 1 })

robotInstructions(
  ["U", "D", "L", "R", "U", "D", "L", "R", "U", "D", "L", "R"]
)
 { "U": 3, "D": 3, "L": 3, "R": 3 })

 Reminders:
These range from easier to more challenging, so don't worry if you can't get them all yet - solve what you can and keep practicing until you can get them all!
Please put one solution per thread so that other students can take a look at your solution for one challenge without spoiling the solution for another
